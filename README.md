#### What this guide and files cover: 
* Sample fiels that you can change and use as your own
* Where to host said files

#### Prerequsisites
* Cisco 794x orr 796x phone running SIP firmware.  It appears that Cisco has removed the 7941 firmware form their downloads site ;(
* PBX that you can succesfully register a 794x or 796x phone with SIP firmware. (Im using FreePBX with Asterisks 15)
* Webserver that can execute php.  You can host these files on you PBX if youd like. Id rather host on a seperate box.
* Hue lights that connect back to a V2 bridge and a valid API key for your bridge. I am linking the guide on how to create an API key. https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/
